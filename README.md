# fe-fun

This repo tracks some fe library I'm building during the moments I'm bored. Currently there is no working version and only a class called `Femesh`is available. This class uses the [`meshio`](https://pypi.org/project/meshio/) library to import GMSH meshes. It also contains some initial basic functionality to perform simple operations on the imported meshes. 

### Getting `meshio`

Simply install through `pip`:

```lang=python
pip install meshio[all]
```
Checkout out the package info on [pipy.org](https://pypi.org/project/meshio/)
